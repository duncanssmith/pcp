<h1> Our Service </h1>

<h2> South East Nutrition and Health </h2>

<h3> South East Nutrition and Health seeks to inspire healthy, balanced living through good diet.</h3>
<p>South East Nutrition and Health, founded by Seamus Kirk, BSc. (Hons) RD HCIMA is passionate about the benefits of nutrition, and the changes good dietary practice can bring. A Health Professions Council (HPC) registered dietitian, and a member of the British Dietetic Association (BDA), the professional body for dietitians in the UK.</p>
<p>Many of the choices we make may be less than optimal for our health; most of us know that too much fat, salt or alcohol, for example, can be harmful, but there are many foods that contain much more fat or salt or sugar than most people realise.

Or it may be that beneficial foods are being omitted from your normal diet.</p>
<p>With food and health so often in the media spotlight, it can be a challenge to know what is best for you.</p>
<p>South East Nutrition and Health provides a full dietetic service to individuals and organisations to help them attain a balanced, healthy diet. This service works through a process of consultation, analysis and recommendations based on a study of the best options for dietary improvement in each case.</p>

<h1>Overview of dietetics</h1>

<p>"A dietitian is a health care professional who focuses on proper food and nutrition in order to promote good health." (reference: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietetics).</p>
<p>Dietetics is the professional practice that matches current scientific knowledge about diet to the practical requirements of food and nutrition.</p>
<p>Dietetic professionals are the only nutrition professionals to be regulated by statute, and they are governed by a code of ethics to ensure they always work to the highest standard and within professional codes of conduct.</p>
<p>Dietitians are specifically trained to apply the most up-to-date public health and scientific research on food, health and disease, and translate this into practical guidance to enable you to make appropriate lifestyle and food choices.</p>
<p>For more information on the British Dietetic Association please see bda.uk.com.</p>
<p>Registered Dietitians are the only qualified health professionals that assess, diagnose and treat diet and nutrition problems at an individual level and the wider public health level.</p>
<p>Dietitians normally qualify with a 4 year Batchelor of Science degree (BSc.) in Nutrition and Dietetics or a 3 year BSc. followed by a Master's degree (MSc.) in Dietetics. These courses typically include practical training working in a hospital and in the community.</p>
<p>The title "Dietitian" can only be used by qualified dietitians who are registered with the Health Professions Council. Please refer to the HPC website for further information.</p>

<h1>Type 2 Diabetes</h1>

<p>Diabetes is a chronic condition, and although it can't be "cured", it can be treated very successfully. You may have just been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes or had it for some time. In either case a dietary consultation can be of benefit.</p>
<p>The ideal aim of treatment is to achieve blood glucose, blood pressure and cholesterol levels as near to normal as possible. This, together with a healthy lifestyle, will help to improve your wellbeing and protect against long-term damage to the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart and major arteries. What you eat, how much activity you do and what your weight is are therefore central to your treatment for diabetes. We can look at all these factors with you and help you to work out a plan to suit you.</p>
<p>You may be taking prescibed medication and/or insulin to help you achieve normal blood glucose levels. Information from your medical practitioner on your medical treatment and medication would be needed prior to a consultation.</p>

<small>
    START NEW CONTENT HERE
Diabetes is a condition in which the amount of glucose (sugar) in the bloodstream is too high because the body cannot control it properly. The blood glucose level is normally kept in range by a hormone called insulin, which is produced from the pancreas. Insulin controls blood glucose levels by allowing glucose to enter the cells so it can be used as fuel by the body. In people with diabetes there is either not enough insulin being produced, or it does not work properly. There are two main types of diabetes, and the approach to food may vary depending on the type of diabetes and the treatment being followed. ÙÄÇä Type 1 diabetes occurs when the body is unable to produce any insulin and this has to be replaced, usually through insulin injections. ÙÄÇä Type 2 diabetes is when the body is able to make some insulin but not enough, or when the insulin produced does not work properly (called 'insulin resistance'). The aim for both types of diabetes is to achieve and maintain the best possible control of blood glucose, blood pressure and cholesterol; which will reduce your risk of diabetes complications in the future. What you eat or don't eat and your physical activity level are vital in controlling all these factors, but that does not mean that you should not still enjoy your food and the occasional 'treat'! All people with diabetes should have access to a dietitian at diagnosis, either through structured patient education in groups or as an individual consultation. You may ask your GP to refer you to a dietitian at any time but this is often useful at times when changes are being made to your diabetes treatment. This fact sheet will give you simple information about healthy food choices suitable for everybody, including adults with diabetes. The national diabetes charity, Diabetes UK, produces more comprehensive information available both online and in print (see www.diabetes.org.uk or call the Careline on 0845 120 2960 for more details). The full range of Food Facts produced by the British Dietetic Association complements the information in this fact sheet and for more details about healthy eating, visit the Food Standards Agency web site at www.eatwell.gov.uk Type 1 diabetes If you have Type 1 diabetes, you should see a dietitian who will help you to understand the balance between the carbohydrate you eat and your insulin doses. This will help you to manage your diabetes more effectively. You will also reduce your risk of long term health problems if you follow some of the key points highlighted for people with type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes Being aware of carbohydrate foods and food portion sizes is important if you have Type 2 diabetes. The following general guidelines will help to manage your diabetes and benefit your general health: ÙÄÇä Eat regularly - aim for three meals a day, including breakfast ÙÄÇä Include some carbohydrate foods with a lower glycaemic index at each meal ÙÄÇä Aim for at least 5-a-day: that's portions of fruits and vegetables ÙÄÇä Eat oily fish such as mackerel, sardines or salmon twice a week ÙÄÇä Eat fewer sugary foods and drinks ÙÄÇä Eat fewer fatty foods, particularly saturated fats ÙÄÇä Eat less salt and salty foods. Eat regularly Aim for healthy balanced meals based around the Balance of Good Health. See the BDA fact sheet 'Getting the Balance Right - A Guide to Healthy Eating' for more information. Include some 'starchy' carbohydrate foods at each meal, such as bread, potatoes, rice, pasta, or chapatti. The larger the portion, the more effect these foods will have on raising blood glucose. Wholegrain starchy foods may help to control your blood glucose. These have a lower 'Glycaemic Index' (G.I.), which helps you to feel full longer, reduce rapid rises & falls in blood glucose and so should be chosen more often. Examples of lower G.I. carbohydrate foods include wholegrain bread, porridge oats, pulses, most fruit and low fat yogurt. Weight Excess weight, in particular around your waist, can make your diabetes harder to control. Losing weight can be difficult but evidence shows that even a small weight loss of just 5-10% of your body weight can bring significant health benefits. Losing weight gradually, about ¬Ω to 1kg (1-2lb) per week is the most effective. You may also need advice about adjustments to your medication if you are making significant changes to your diet and physical activity level. Fruits & Vegetables Eating more fruits and vegetables will lower your risk of heart disease, strokes and some cancers. Contrary to popular belief, people with diabetes can eat all types of fruit, but eating large quantities, for example several portions at once, will raise blood glucose. That's why it's useful to know what counts as one portion: ÙÄÇä One piece of ordinary sized fruit, e.g. apple, orange, banana ÙÄÇä Two small fruits, e.g. plums or satsumas ÙÄÇä A handful of grapes or a slice of a large fruit, e.g. melon ÙÄÇä ¬Ω - 1 tablespoon of dried fruit, e.g. sultanas ÙÄÇä A small glass of pure fruit juice (150ml) ÙÄÇä 2-3 tablespoon of cooked vegetables or a small bowl of mixed salad. Oily Fish The Omega-3 fats found in oily fish may have several health benefits but in particular eating more oily fish can protect your heart, so it's recommended people with diabetes eat one or two portions each week. Examples of oily fish include mackerel, sardines, salmon, trout and herring. Fish oil supplements are not generally recommended but speak to your doctor or dietitian for personalised advice. Sugar It's not necessary to follow a sugar-free diet, nor would it be possible to. Choose lower sugar or reduced-sugar foods where possible. The amount of sugar in savoury foods is not usually significant. Artificial sweeteners can be useful for people with diabetes, especially if trying to lose weight Fats Fat is extremely high in calories so eating less fat and fatty foods will help you lose weight. Saturated fats, such as those found in pastry, butter, fatty meat and high-fat dairy foods like cheese, are linked to heart disease so reduce this type of fat as much as possible. Replace it with leaner and reduced fat versions, and with monounsaturated fats such as rapeseed oil, pure vegetable oil, olive oil and spreads made from these. Salt It's recommended that we have less than 6g of salt per day. Prepackaged and convenience foods contain a lot of salt, so a simple way to reduce your salt intake is to include more fresh food and 'home cooking' in your diet. Lowering your salt intake will help to improve your blood pressure and reduce your risk of heart disease, strokes and some cancers. Alcohol There's generally no reason why people with diabetes should not drink alcohol, unless you have been advised not to, but it is important to stick to the safe limits. That's up to two units per day for women and up to three units per day for men. A small glass of wine (125ml) is usually about 1¬Ω units, while a pint of ordinary strength (3.5%) beer is roughly two units. Single pub measures (25ml) of spirits are also one unit. Alcohol is high in calories, so if you're trying to lose weight it can be helpful to reduce your intake of alcoholic drinks. 'Diabetic' Foods Foods labelled as 'diabetic', such as sweets, cakes and chocolates, offer no special benefits and are not recommended. They may be high in fat and calories, are expensive and some may cause diarrhoea. Physical Activity Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity on five days of the week. 'Moderate' means breathing more deeply and feeling warmer, e.g. walking, gardening, housework etc. This Food Fact sheet is a public service of The British Dietetic Association intended for information only.

<h1>Nutrition and Heart Health</h1>

<p>A healthy diet can help to protect you against heart disease. Good nutrition can play a significant part in reducing the main risk factors for heart disease: high cholesterol, overweight and high blood pressure.</p>
<p>We can provide you with the latest evidence showing the links between diet and heart health, and we can have a closer look at your diet, and recommend changes that would help reduce your risk. This is an excellent time to consider what changes and additions to your diet could help to protect your heart health in the long term.</p>

=================================================================

<h1>IBS - Irritable Bowel Syndrome</h1>

<p>IBS is a bowel disorder characterized by abdominal pain, discomfort, bloating, and alteration of bowel habits. In some cases, symptoms are relieved by bowel movements. Symptoms include diarrhoea, constipation, or both, alternating. IBS may begin after an infection, a stressful life event, or the onset of maturity.</p>

<p>Although there is no cure for IBS, there are treatments that can relieve symptoms. These include changes in diet, medication and psychological treatments.</p>

<p>Several conditions may present as IBS including coeliac disease, fructose malabsorption, mild infections, parasitic infections like giardiasis, several inflammatory bowel diseases, bile acid malabsorption, functional chronic constipation, and chronic functional abdominal pain. In IBS, routine clinical tests yield no abnormalities, although the bowels are often more sensitive to certain stimuli. The exact cause of IBS is unknown. The most common theory is that IBS is a disorder of the interaction between the brain and the gastrointestinal tract, although there may also be abnormalities in the gut flora or the immune system.</p>

<p>IBS does not lead to more serious conditions in most patients, however, it is a source of chronic pain, fatigue, and other symptoms and contributes to work absenteeism. Researchers have reported that the high prevalence of IBS, in conjunction with increased costs, produces a disease with a high social cost. It is also regarded as a chronic illness and can dramatically affect the quality of a sufferer's life.</p>

=================================================================

<h1>Mineral and Vitamin Deficiency</h1>

<p>Mineral and vitamin deficiencies in the diet can have a wide range of effects.</p>

<p>Vitamins are essential components of the diet, and deficiencies result in very specific diseases. Certain foods are rich in some vitamins, while others contain very low levels. For a dietitian it is important to understand and identify the whole range of vitamin deficiency symptoms, and to also know the best dietary sources, in order to be able to make correct diagnoses and to recommend effective treatments.</p>

<p>Good nutrition is also essential in providing the minerals we all require for good health. As with vitamins, certain foods are rich in essential minerals, while others may have none. Identifying the symptoms of mineral deficiency is the route to diagnosis and treatment.</p>

<p>Mineral and vitamin supplements can help, but in most cases dietary changes can provide the required replenishment of these vital nutrients.</p>


=================================================================

<h1>Food Allergy and Intolerance</h1>

<p>Allergic reactions and intolerance to certain foods can have an enormous impact on everyday life of those affected. In many cases sufferers are not aware that they are allergic to particular foods.</p>

<p>There is a great deal of information in the public domain related to food intolerance, much of it based on conjecture and hearsay. We take a realistic attitude to the diagnosis and treatment of allergies and food intolerance, and base our recommendations on current scientific knowledge.</p>

<p>Food allergies and intolerances can be analysed and identified and then treated with the help of nutritional advice from a dietitian.</p>


=================================================================

<h1>Weight Loss</h1>

<p>Going on a diet to lose weight is an ever-popular activity, but do diets really work? Sometimes, yes, they can; however maintaining a healthy weight requires understanding or your own particular dietary needs, (as well as work and dedication!) Following a weight-loss diet that doesn't accurately match your needs is difficult. It can also be ineffective, as weight can return as willpower wanes.</p>

<p>Our everyday diet is often habitual and based on learned behaviours. Successful and permanent weight loss may mean changing these behaviours, and simultaneously developing skills and strategies to deal with the changes.</p>

<p>We can help you understand all aspects of your weight management and help you achieve your goal to maintain a healthy, ideal weight.</p>


=================================================================

<h1>Healthy Eating for Families</h1>

<p>Nutrition is an essential part of family life, and it is especially important to ensure that family members of all ages are eating the right foods in the right quantities to suit their needs. As babies and children develop, their nutritional needs change too. Certain foods that are correctly balanced in nutrients for young children are less beneficial for adults, and adults may have requirements that are not satisfied by these same foods.</p>

<p>It is therefore essential to be aware of the varied needs of all family members in order to provide a healthy diet for everyone.</p>


=================================================================

<h1>Vegetarian and Vegan Nutrition</h1>

<p>Vegetarian and vegan diets are healthy and nutritious and delicious, however as any vegetarian or vegan knows it is important to have an understanding of the particular types of foods that are essential in order to achieve a balanced diet.</p>

<p>Non-vegetarians meet most of their protein needs through the consumption of meat or fish, whereas vegetarians and vegans must source their protein from good vegetable sources such as beans and peas and lentils (pulses) and grain-based foods such as bread.</p>

<small>
START NEW CONTENT HERE
Being vegetarian means different things to different people. Some people include 'white' meats, such as fish or chicken (semivegetarian). Others avoid all meat but still enjoy dairy products and eggs (lacto-ovo-vegetarian). Vegans avoid using any animal product, from meat and eggs to leather shoes. Whichever type of vegetarian you are, you still need to make sure you get all the nutrients your body needs. An easy way to plan your diet is to think about the food groups. Bread, other cereals and potatoes This food group, especially wholegrain products and fortified breakfast cereals, contributes essential nutrients such as iron and zinc. These foods should form the basis of every meal. Focus on fruit and vegetables Aim for five servings of fruit and vegetables each day. Those containing vitamin C, including citrus fruits, berries, melon, tomatoes and peppers, increase the absorption of iron from non-meat foods, so are especially valuable if you are vegetarian. Try and have a glass of orange juice with your breakfast cereal perhaps or peppers in a stir-fry with brown rice. Alternatives to meat It is especially important if you are vegetarian to get your protein, iron and zinc from sources other than meat. Choose from the foods listed below - in combination with grain foods, these provide us with protein equivalent to that from animal foods: ÙÄÇÑ Soya-based foods, including tofu ÙÄÇÑ Beans, lentils and chickpeas (dried or tinned) ÙÄÇÑ Seeds, nuts and nut butters, like peanut butter (although these tend to be high in fat) ÙÄÇÑ Eggs (if you eat them) Don't forget dairy foods or their alternatives Be sure to include these foods several times a day if you don't eat dairy foods as you need to keep your calcium intake up: ÙÄÇÑ Calcium-fortified soya milk, puddings and orange juice ÙÄÇÑ Tofu ÙÄÇÑ Brown or white bread ÙÄÇÑ Dried fruit, eg apricots ÙÄÇÑ Green leafy vegetables (apart from spinach) ÙÄÇÑ Nuts and sesame seeds ÙÄÇÑ Tinned salmon & sardines (if you eat fish) Other concerns If you rarely or never eat animal foods you need to make sure you are getting enough vitamin D, vitamin B2 and vitamin B12. Vitamin D is generated by sunlight on our skin, but if you don't go outside much or if you have dark skin, you should include fortified margarine or spreads and fortified breakfast cereals in your diet. You may also need a supplement. For vitamin B2 and B12 try to have fortified breakfast cereal, soya foods or yeast extract regularly - otherwise consider a supplement. If you are a vegan you should also include small amounts of iodised salt or seaweed. It is also important to take extra care during pregnancy, breastfeeding, weaning or in childhood to make sure that all nutritional needs are being met. Additional dietary advice may be needed. While there are many health benefits to being a vegetarian, remember, there is more to it than just giving up meat. Any diet that is not planned properly can mean that you miss out on essential nutrients. Following these guidelines will ensure that you enjoy all the health benefits as well as a nutritious and complete vegetarian diet.

<h1>Cancer</h1>

<p>Cancer and cancer treatments are often associated with nutritional problems. Your body must get the calories and nutrients it needs to maintain a healthy weight.</p>

<p>Cancer treatment places a high demand on the body. Nutrition support may help you maintain your body weight and meet your body's energy and nutrient requirements at this vital time.</p>

<p>A consultation with a dietitian will help you to prepare for the effects of the treatments for cancer, and can help to ensure that your particular nutritional needs are met at this time.</p>


=================================================================

<h1>Coeliac disease</h1>

<p>Coeliac disease is a genetically transmitted autoimmune disorder of the small intestine that occurs in those predisposed people of all ages from middle infancy onward.</p>

<p>Symptoms include chronic diarrhoea, failure to thrive (in children) and fatigue, but these may be absent, and symptoms in other organ systems have been described.</p>

<p>Proper nutrition is essential in managing coeliac disease, and a nutritional consultation is highly recommended.</p>

=================================================================

<h1>PCOS - Polycystic Ovary Syndrome</h1>

<p>PCOS is a disease caused by hormone imbalance in women. Weight gain and difficulty in losing weight are common symptoms, as are irregular or no periods, facial hair, acne and infertility.</p>

<p>Insulin is a hormone made in the pancreas which helps the body use energy from food. Insulin resistance occurs when the body does not respond to normal levels of insulin and this results in more insulin production. High levels of insulin encourage the body to store fat which can lead to weight gain. As weight goes up, insulin resistance increases. Insulin also promotes the production of testosterone in the body. Testosterone is often thought of as a male hormone but women need a small amount. However, having even slightly higher amounts can upset the balance of hormones in the body and lead to acne, excess hair and irregular periods. Irregular periods may result in infertility. Long term health concerns associated with PCOS are linked to insulin resistance and include heart disease and diabetes.</p>

<p>Risk factors include:</p>
Altered levels of fats in the blood
High blood pressure
Being overweight and, in particular, having lots of fat around your middle.
Many women with PCOS also suffer with insulin resistance, where the body resists the effects of insulin and so produces more to compensate. Continuously high insulin levels keep blood sugar levels low, which can prompt cravings for carbohydrate-rich foods. This causes the symptomatic weight gain.</p>

<p>Insulin resistance also increases the risk of longer-term health problems. Women with PCOS are, for example, seven times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes or have a heart attack. With correct diet, treatment and weight management, the risk of diabetes and heart attack can be reduced. Losing between 5% and 10% of excess body weight is enough to reduce the risk of diabetes and heart disease, and can improve fertility, and the other symptoms of PCOS.</p>

<p>A consultation with a dietitian will help you identify the most effective weight loss strategy for you, and therefore move you closer to coping with PCOS symptoms.</p>

Symptoms of PCOS include:

<ul>
    <li>Irregular or absent periods</li>
    <li>Excessive hair (hirsutism) particularly on the face, chest or stomach</li>
    <li> Thinning of scalp hair or male-pattern baldness</li>
    <li> Acne</li>
    <li> Difficulty in maintaining a healthy body weight</li>
    <li> Fertility problems (difficulty conceiving)</li>
 </ul
<p> PCOS can be diagnosed by any combination of blood test results, an ultrasound scan or from a history of symptoms. Sometimes the cysts may not be seen during a scan but a diagnosis can still be made using symptoms and blood test results.</li>

<h2>PCOS and insulin resistance</h2>
<p>Insulin is a hormone made in the pancreas which helps the body use energy from food. Insulin resistance occurs when the body does not respond to normal levels of insulin and this results in more insulin production. High levels of insulin encourage the body to store fat which can lead to weight gain. As weight goes up, insulin resistance increases. Insulin also promotes the production of testosterone in the body. Testosterone is often thought of as a male hormone but women need a small amount. However, having even slightly higher amounts can upset the balance of hormones in the body and lead to acne, excess hair and irregular periods. Irregular periods may result in infertility. Long term health concerns associated with PCOS are linked to insulin resistance and include heart disease and diabetes.</p>

<h2>Risk factors include:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Altered levels of fats in the blood</li>
    <li>High blood pressure</li>
    <li>Being overweight and, in particular, having lots of fat around your middle.</li>
</ul>

<p> The symptoms of PCOS can be controlled using a combination of lifestyle changes, cosmetic measures and medication. Studies show that physical activity and weight loss are the most effective ways to improve insulin resistance and symptoms.</p>

<h2>What do you need to do with your diet?</h2>
<p>It has been shown that even a 5% reduction in body weight can improve symptoms for overweight women with PCOS. The best way to lose weight is unclear and different things work for different people. Some women find slimming clubs helpful, some like to count calories or use meal replacements and others find cutting down portion sizes can help. The most important thing is finding something which suits your lifestyle without missing out on important foods.</p>
<p>For more information on healthy eating, check out the BDA factsheet titled 'Getting the balance right- a guide to healthy eating'.</p>
<p>What about carbohydrates? Low carbohydrate diets and low glycaemic index (GI) diets are often promoted for the treatment of PCOS. Changing the amounts or type of carbohydrate you eat may affect insulin levels. There is no evidence that low carbohydrate diets work in PCOS and nothing is known about the long-term side effects. Some women find that swapping some high GI foods for low GI foods helpful. Take a look at the BDA factsheet titled 'Glycaemic index' for more information. PCOS and the importance of physical activity There are many benefits to be gained from being physically active but the most relevant to PCOS is that it improves insulin resistance. There are lots of reasons why some women struggle to increase their exercise levels including finding the time and energy to do it. The most important thing is to find something that you enjoy and can fit into your lifestyle. Build it up gradually aiming to be active for at least 30 minutes on most or all of the days of the week for heart health but the recommendations for achieving weight loss is 60 minutes per day. Remember that anything which is more than usual for you, will be a great start. Do you need to take herbal supplements? There are currently no good quality studies which have shown that herbal supplements such as Agnus Castus and Saw Palmetto are of benefit in PCOS.

<h1>Nutrition for the elderly</h1>

<p>The elderly often have special dietary requirements. As we age, we typically require slightly less of some nutrients and more of others. Diet can also play a part in helping to improve the quality of life of elderly people, as food is one of life's great pleasures, and as we get older we should be allowed to enjoy our food as much as we ever did.</p>

<p>A consultation with a dietitian will help you ensure that you or your elderly loved ones are being properly cared for in their nutritional needs.</p>


=================================================================

<h1>Lethargy and loss of vitality</h1>

<p>Chronic lethargy and loss of vitality can sometimes be related to nutrition. This is especially true in cases where an allergy or food intolerance has gone unnoticed, or when there is a medical condition present that has been un-diagnosed or untreated.</p>

<p>Correct and appropriate diet can help play a part in improving vitality and energy levels.</p>

<p>A consultation with a dietitian will help you to identify any possible dietary reasons for your condition, and may help you regain your exuberance and full energy levels.</p>
