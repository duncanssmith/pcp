                          Nestled in Worthing’s stunning Beach House Park, Palm Court Pavilion is a stylish,<br>
                          beautifully renovated café-bistro in the park’s Old Pavilion. Located just minutes from<br>
                          the town centre and the seafront, Palm Court Pavilion serves delicious homemade food<br>
                          and has a range of options for functions and events.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The cafe is an exciting new chapter in the Pavilion’s interesting history; after some years<br>
                          in disuse, the Pavilion has been given a new lease of life. The landmark building has been<br>
                          sympathetically renovated, emphasising the natural light and an extensive outdoor decking<br>
                          area makes the most of the beautiful park setting. Both areas of decking can be used for<br>
                          private parties.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The upstairs function room has a balcony giving delightful views of the park and bowling<br>
                          greens, a perfect venue for parties, meetings and events.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The outside space in the park can also be used for larger scale events of up to 1000 people,<br>
                          ideal for weddings, dining, exhibitions, corporate launches, markets and roadshows.<br>
                        </p>
