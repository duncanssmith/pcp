The caf&eacute; marks an exciting new chapter in the Pavilionâ€™s history. After some years in disuse, the old Pavilion building has been given a brand new lease of life with a sympathetic renovation emphasising natural light inside, while taking advantage of the lovely open-air spaces of the surrounding park outside.

<p class="float-text">
Large open-air decking areas have been created so that you can enjoy the beautiful, peaceful setting.

The outside spaces are also available for hire for private parties and functions.
