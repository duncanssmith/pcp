The caf&eacute; marks an exciting new chapter in the Pavilionâ€™s history. After some years in disuse, the Pavilion has been given a new lease of life. The landmark building has been sympathetically renovated to emphasise natural light inside, and large decking areas outside have been added so that visitors can enjoy the beautiful park setting. The decking areas can also be used for private parties or functions.
