The caf&eacute; marks an exciting new chapter in the Pavilionâ€™s history. After some years in disuse, the Pavilion has been given a new lease of life. The landmark building has been sympathetically renovated to emphasise natural light inside, and large open-air decking areas have been added so that you can enjoy the beautiful park setting. The open-air spaces can be used for private parties and functions.
